### Stanford Cars
- The goal of this series of notebooks is to achieve 90%+ accuracy using fastai
- My current best is **89.4%** accuracy 

### Feature Testing
- RGB Transforms: Tested whether different types of RGB transforms could improve validatoin accuracy for image classification. Randomly zeroing out 1 channel had the best improvement. Prompted after discussion on the fastai formum here: https://forums.fast.ai/t/rgb-transformations-for-data-augmentation/36876/8

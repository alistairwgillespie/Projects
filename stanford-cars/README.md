# Standford Cars  - Image Classification

Image classification of the stanford-cars dataset leveraging the fastai v1. The goal is to try hit 90%+ accuracy, starting with a basic fastai image classification workflow and interating from there. My 90%+ goal is based on @sgugger's code implementing Adam for the Stanford Cars dataset, here: https://github.com/sgugger/Adam-experiments
